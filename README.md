# text_from_images
Google Vision based OCR tool for data extraction. 

# Shadow for Github

Simple CLI program that bulk extracts text from images and consolidates them into a single clean Word (.docx) document for further text processing.

-->> Best when you have several individual images but need to consolidate all the extracted text data into a single word document. The output treats each subfolder as its own block of data. <<--


## Features

- Supports nested subfolder processing. Each subfolder stores the bulk of images (for large image-text extraction) and consolidates them into a single clearly delimited docx. file. 
- Extracts text from individual images inside a main folder.
- Generates a formatted Word document (.docx) with extracted texts.


## Path

- Main folder -> iterates each subfolder -> google vision api -> single .docx document 

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `google-cloud-vision`
- `python-docx`
